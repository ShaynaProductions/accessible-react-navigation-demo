# React Accessible Navigation Demonstration

This codebase features a series of releases demonstrating building an accessible navigation component for React. Each release builds upon the last, and is presented alongside a series of articles on [DEV](https://dev.to/shaynaproductions) explaining the concepts.

This repository has been built with Typescript on React 19 and Next.JS 16 and will remain so. Where used, some of the base components are composed from [Adobe React Aria Components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html).

As explained in the articles, this repository is presented as a demonstration, rather than a third party component, but the code is released under an MIT license and you are free to use it as the basis of your own navigation component.

## Running the Examples

You will need [the latest version of Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) (currently set at 4.12)

Once you've downloaded the repository run the following in a terminal in the project root.
yarn
yarn build
yarn dev

You will now have a fully working example site located at localhost:3000/
